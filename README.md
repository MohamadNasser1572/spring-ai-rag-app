# Spring AI RAG App

A lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built using **Spring Boot** and **Spring AI**. It demonstrates how to process documents, store them in a vector store, and query them using an AI model to get context-aware answers.

## 🔍 Features

- Document ingestion and token-based splitting
- Vector store integration (memory-based or open source)
- Question Answering using Spring AI Advisors
- Easily switch between OpenAI or open source models (e.g. LLaMA, Nomic Embed)
- Token-based document chunking for better performance

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Java + Spring Boot
- Spring AI
- Spring Web
- OpenAI / Local open-source LLMs
- Vector Store (In-Memory / custom)
- Lombok

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven
- Optional: OpenAI API key or open-source model installed locally

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohamadNasser1572/spring-ai-rag-app.git
cd spring-ai-rag-app
mvn clean install
````

### Run the App

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Read** documents from local files
2. **Split** them using a token text splitter
3. **Index** them in a vector store
4. **Ask** questions using Spring AI's QuestionAnswerAdvisor
5. Get AI-generated responses grounded in your documents
